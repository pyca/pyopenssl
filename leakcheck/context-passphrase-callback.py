Stress tester for thread-related bugs in global_passphrase_callback in
src/ssl/context.c.  In 0.7 and earlier, this will somewhat reliably segfault or
abort after a few dozen to a few thousand iterations on an SMP machine
(generally not on a UP machine) due to uses of Python/C API without holding the
GIL.
