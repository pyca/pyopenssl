"""
Stress tester for thread-related bugs in ssl_Connection_send and
ssl_Connection_recv in src/ssl/connection.c for usage of a single Connection
object simultaneously in multiple threads.  In 0.7 and earlier, this will
somewhat reliably cause Python to abort with a "tstate mix-up" almost
immediately, due to the incorrect sharing between threads of the `tstate` field
of the connection object.
