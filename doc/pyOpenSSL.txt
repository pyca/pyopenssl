  Abstract:

   This module is a rather thin wrapper around (a subset of) the OpenSSL
   library. With thin wrapper I mean that a lot of the object methods do
   nothing more than calling a corresponding function in the OpenSSL
   library.

                                 1 Introduction

   The reason pyOpenSSL was created is that the SSL support in the socket
   module in Python 2.1 (the contemporary version of Python when the
   pyOpenSSL project was begun) was severely limited. Other OpenSSL
   wrappers for Python at the time were also limited, though in different
   ways. Unfortunately, Python's standard library SSL support has remained
   weak, although other packages (such as M2Crypto^1) have made great
   advances and now equal or exceed pyOpenSSL's functionality.

   The reason pyOpenSSL continues to be maintained is that there is a
   significant user community around it, as well as a large amount of
   software which depends on it. It is a great benefit to many people for
   pyOpenSSL to continue to exist and advance.


                           2 Building and Installing

   These instructions can also be found in the file INSTALL.

   I have tested this on Debian Linux systems (woody and sid), Solaris 2.6
   and 2.7. Others have successfully compiled it on Windows and NT.


2.1 Building the Module on a Unix System

   pyOpenSSL uses distutils, so there really shouldn't be any problems. To
   build the library:

python setup.py build

   If your OpenSSL header files aren't in /usr/include, you may need to
   supply the -I flag to let the setup script know where to look. The same
   goes for the libraries of course, use the -L flag. Note that build
   won't accept these flags, so you have to run first build_ext and then
   build! Example:

python setup.py build_ext -I/usr/local/ssl/include -L/usr/local/ssl/lib
python setup.py build

   Now you should have a directory called OpenSSL that contains e.g.
   SSL.so and __init__.py somewhere in the build dicrectory, so just:

python setup.py install

   If you, for some arcane reason, don't want the module to appear in the
   site-packages directory, use the --prefix option.

   You can, of course, do

python setup.py --help

   to find out more about how to use the script.


2.2 Building the Module on a Windows System

   Big thanks to Itamar Shtull-Trauring and Oleg Orlov for their help with
   Windows build instructions. Same as for Unix systems, we have to
   separate the build_ext and the build.

   Building the library:

setup.py build_ext -I ...\openssl\inc32 -L ...\openssl\out32dll
setup.py build

   Where ...\openssl is of course the location of your OpenSSL
   installation.

   Installation is the same as for Unix systems:

setup.py install

   And similarily, you can do

setup.py --help

   to get more information.

3.2 rand -- An interface to the OpenSSL pseudo random number generator

   This module handles the OpenSSL pseudo random number generator (PRNG)
   and declares the following:

   add(string, entropy)
          Mix bytes from string into the PRNG state. The entropy argument
          is (the lower bound of) an estimate of how much randomness is
          contained in string, measured in bytes. For more information,
          see e.g. RFC 1750.

   bytes(num_bytes)
          Get some random bytes from the PRNG as a string.

          This is a wrapper for the C function RAND_bytes.

   cleanup()
          Erase the memory used by the PRNG.

          This is a wrapper for the C function RAND_cleanup.

   egd(path[, bytes])
          Query the Entropy Gathering Daemon^2 on socket path for bytes
          bytes of random data and and uses add to seed the PRNG. The
          default value of bytes is 255.

   load_file(path[, bytes])
          Read bytes bytes (or all of it, if bytes is negative) of data
          from the file path to seed the PRNG. The default value of bytes
          is -1.

   screen()
          Add the current contents of the screen to the PRNG state.
          Availability: Windows.

   seed(string)
          This is equivalent to calling add with entropy as the length of
          the string.

   status()
          Returns true if the PRNG has been seeded with enough data, and
          false otherwise.

   write_file(path)
          Write a number of random bytes (currently 1024) to the file
          path. This file can then be used with load_file to seed the PRNG
          again.

   exception Error
          If the current RAND method supports any errors, this is raised
          when needed. The default method does not raise this when the
          entropy pool is depleted.

          Whenever this exception is raised directly, it has a list of
          error messages from the OpenSSL error queue, where each item is
          a tuple (lib, function, reason). Here lib, function and reason
          are all strings, describing where and what the problem is. See
          err(3) for more information.


3.3 SSL -- An interface to the SSL-specific parts of OpenSSL

   This module handles things specific to SSL. There are two objects
   defined: Context, Connection.

   SSLv2_METHOD

   SSLv3_METHOD

   SSLv23_METHOD

   TLSv1_METHOD
          These constants represent the different SSL methods to use when
          creating a context object.

   VERIFY_NONE

   VERIFY_PEER

   VERIFY_FAIL_IF_NO_PEER_CERT
          These constants represent the verification mode used by the
          Context object's set_verify method.

   FILETYPE_PEM

   FILETYPE_ASN1
          File type constants used with the use_certificate_file and
          use_privatekey_file methods of Context objects.

   OP_SINGLE_DH_USE

   OP_EPHEMERAL_RSA

   OP_NO_SSLv2

   OP_NO_SSLv3

   OP_NO_TLSv1
          Constants used with set_options of Context objects.
          OP_SINGLE_DH_USE means to always create a new key when using
          ephemeral Diffie-Hellman. OP_EPHEMERAL_RSA means to always use
          ephemeral RSA keys when doing RSA operations. OP_NO_SSLv2,
          OP_NO_SSLv3 and OP_NO_TLSv1 means to disable those specific
          protocols. This is interesting if you're using e.g.
          SSLv23_METHOD to get an SSLv2-compatible handshake, but don't
          want to use SSLv2.

   ContextType
          See Context.

   class Context(method)
          A class representing SSL contexts. Contexts define the
          parameters of one or more SSL connections.

          method should be SSLv2_METHOD, SSLv3_METHOD, SSLv23_METHOD or
          TLSv1_METHOD.

   ConnectionType
          See Connection.

   class Connection(context, socket)
          A class representing SSL connections.

          context should be an instance of Context and socket should be a
          socket ^3 object. socket may be None; in this case, the
          Connection is created with a memory BIO: see the bio_read,
          bio_write, and bio_shutdown methods.

   exception Error
          This exception is used as a base class for the other SSL-related
          exceptions, but may also be raised directly.

          Whenever this exception is raised directly, it has a list of
          error messages from the OpenSSL error queue, where each item is
          a tuple (lib, function, reason). Here lib, function and reason
          are all strings, describing where and what the problem is. See
          err(3) for more information.

   exception ZeroReturnError
          This exception matches the error return code
          SSL_ERROR_ZERO_RETURN, and is raised when the SSL Connection has
          been closed. In SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0, this only occurs if a
          closure alert has occurred in the protocol, i.e. the connection
          has been closed cleanly. Note that this does not necessarily
          mean that the transport layer (e.g. a socket) has been closed.

          It may seem a little strange that this is an exception, but it
          does match an SSL_ERROR code, and is very convenient.

   exception WantReadError
          The operation did not complete; the same I/O method should be
          called again later, with the same arguments. Any I/O method can
          lead to this since new handshakes can occur at any time.

          The wanted read is for dirty data sent over the network, not the
          clean data inside the tunnel. For a socket based SSL connection,
          read means data coming at us over the network. Until that read
          succeeds, the attempted OpenSSL.SSL.Connection.recv,
          OpenSSL.SSL.Connection.send, or
          OpenSSL.SSL.Connection.do_handshake is prevented or incomplete.
          You probably want to select() on the socket before trying again.

   exception WantWriteError
          See WantReadError. The socket send buffer may be too full to
          write more data.

   exception WantX509LookupError
          The operation did not complete because an application callback
          has asked to be called again. The I/O method should be called
          again later, with the same arguments. Note: This won't occur in
          this version, as there are no such callbacks in this version.

   exception SysCallError
          The SysCallError occurs when there's an I/O error and OpenSSL's
          error queue does not contain any information. This can mean two
          things: An error in the transport protocol, or an end of file
          that violates the protocol. The parameter to the exception is
          always a pair (errnum, errstr).


  3.3.1 Context objects

   Context objects have the following methods:

   check_privatekey()
          Check if the private key (loaded with use_privatekey[_file])
          matches the certificate (loaded with use_certificate[_file]).
          Returns None if they match, raises Error otherwise.

   get_app_data()
          Retrieve application data as set by set_app_data.

   get_cert_store()
          Retrieve the certificate store (a X509Store object) that the
          context uses. This can be used to add "trusted" certificates
          without using the. load_verify_locations() method.

   get_timeout()
          Retrieve session timeout, as set by set_timeout. The default is
          300 seconds.

   get_verify_depth()
          Retrieve the Context object's verify depth, as set by
          set_verify_depth.

   get_verify_mode()
          Retrieve the Context object's verify mode, as set by set_verify.

   load_client_ca(pemfile)
          Read a file with PEM-formatted certificates that will be sent to
          the client when requesting a client certificate.

   set_client_ca_list(certificate_authorities)
          Replace the current list of preferred certificate signers that
          would be sent to the client when requesting a client certificate
          with the certificate_authorities sequence of
          OpenSSL.crypto.X509Names.

          New in version 0.10.

   add_client_ca(certificate_authority)
          Extract a OpenSSL.crypto.X509Name from the certificate_authority
          OpenSSL.crypto.X509 certificate and add it to the list of
          preferred certificate signers sent to the client when requesting
          a client certificate.

          New in version 0.10.

   load_verify_locations(pemfile, capath)
          Specify where CA certificates for verification purposes are
          located. These are trusted certificates. Note that the
          certificates have to be in PEM format. If capath is passed, it
          must be a directory prepared using the c_rehash tool included
          with OpenSSL. Either, but not both, of pemfile or capath may be
          None.

   set_default_verify_paths()
          Specify that the platform provided CA certificates are to be
          used for verification purposes. This method may not work
          properly on OS X.

   load_tmp_dh(dhfile)
          Load parameters for Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman from dhfile.

   set_app_data(data)
          Associate data with this Context object. data can be retrieved
          later using the get_app_data method.

   set_cipher_list(ciphers)
          Set the list of ciphers to be used in this context. See the
          OpenSSL manual for more information (e.g. ciphers(1))

   set_info_callback(callback)
          Set the information callback to callback. This function will be
          called from time to time during SSL handshakes. callback should
          take three arguments: a Connection object and two integers. The
          first integer specifies where in the SSL handshake the function
          was called, and the other the return code from a (possibly
          failed) internal function call.

   set_options(options)
          Add SSL options. Options you have set before are not cleared!
          This method should be used with the OP_* constants.

   set_passwd_cb(callback[, userdata])
          Set the passphrase callback to callback. This function will be
          called when a private key with a passphrase is loaded. callback
          must accept three positional arguments. First, an integer giving
          the maximum length of the passphrase it may return. If the
          returned passphrase is longer than this, it will be truncated.
          Second, a boolean value which will be true if the user should be
          prompted for the passphrase twice and the callback should verify
          that the two values supplied are equal. Third, the value given
          as the userdata parameter to set_passwd_cb. If an error occurs,
          callback should return a false value (e.g. an empty string).

   set_session_id(name)
          Set the context name within which a session can be reused for
          this Context object. This is needed when doing session
          resumption, because there is no way for a stored session to know
          which Context object it is associated with. name may be any
          binary data.

   set_timeout(timeout)
          Set the timeout for newly created sessions for this Context
          object to timeout. timeout must be given in (whole) seconds. The
          default value is 300 seconds. See the OpenSSL manual for more
          information (e.g. SSL_CTX_set_timeout(3)).

   set_verify(mode, callback)
          Set the verification flags for this Context object to mode and
          specify that callback should be used for verification callbacks.
          mode should be one of VERIFY_NONE and VERIFY_PEER. If
          VERIFY_PEER is used, mode can be OR:ed with
          VERIFY_FAIL_IF_NO_PEER_CERT and VERIFY_CLIENT_ONCE to further
          control the behaviour. callback should take five arguments: A
          Connection object, an X509 object, and three integer variables,
          which are in turn potential error number, error depth and return
          code. callback should return true if verification passes and
          false otherwise.

   set_verify_depth(depth)
          Set the maximum depth for the certificate chain verification
          that shall be allowed for this Context object.

   use_certificate(cert)
          Use the certificate cert which has to be a X509 object.

   add_extra_chain_cert(cert)
          Adds the certificate cert, which has to be a X509 object, to the
          certificate chain presented together with the certificate.

   use_certificate_chain_file(file)
          Load a certificate chain from file which must be PEM encoded.

   use_privatekey(pkey)
          Use the private key pkey which has to be a PKey object.

   use_certificate_file(file[, format])
          Load the first certificate found in file. The certificate must
          be in the format specified by format, which is either
          FILETYPE_PEM or FILETYPE_ASN1. The default is FILETYPE_PEM.

   use_privatekey_file(file[, format])
          Load the first private key found in file. The private key must
          be in the format specified by format, which is either
          FILETYPE_PEM or FILETYPE_ASN1. The default is FILETYPE_PEM.


  3.3.2 Connection objects

   Connection objects have the following methods:

   accept()
          Call the accept method of the underlying socket and set up SSL
          on the returned socket, using the Context object supplied to
          this Connection object at creation. Returns a pair (conn,
          address). where conn is the new Connection object created, and
          address is as returned by the socket's accept.

   bind(address)
          Call the bind method of the underlying socket.

   close()
          Call the close method of the underlying socket. Note: If you
          want correct SSL closure, you need to call the shutdown method
          first.

   connect(address)
          Call the connect method of the underlying socket and set up SSL
          on the socket, using the Context object supplied to this
          Connection object at creation.

   connect_ex(address)
          Call the connect_ex method of the underlying socket and set up
          SSL on the socket, using the Context object supplied to this
          Connection object at creation. Note that if the connect_ex
          method of the socket doesn't return 0, SSL won't be initialized.

   do_handshake()
          Perform an SSL handshake (usually called after renegotiate or
          one of set_accept_state or set_accept_state). This can raise the
          same exceptions as send and recv.

   fileno()
          Retrieve the file descriptor number for the underlying socket.

   listen(backlog)
          Call the listen method of the underlying socket.

   get_app_data()
          Retrieve application data as set by set_app_data.

   get_cipher_list()
          Retrieve the list of ciphers used by the Connection object.
          WARNING: This API has changed. It used to take an optional
          parameter and just return a string, but not it returns the
          entire list in one go.

   get_client_ca_list()
          Retrieve the list of preferred client certificate issuers sent
          by the server as OpenSSL.crypto.X509Name objects.

          If this is a client Connection, the list will be empty until the
          connection with the server is established.

          If this is a server Connection, return the list of certificate
          authorities that will be sent or has been sent to the client, as
          controlled by this Connection's Context.

          New in version 0.10.

   get_context()
          Retrieve the Context object associated with this Connection.

   get_peer_certificate()
          Retrieve the other side's certificate (if any)

   getpeername()
          Call the getpeername method of the underlying socket.

   getsockname()
          Call the getsockname method of the underlying socket.

   getsockopt(level, optname[, buflen])
          Call the getsockopt method of the underlying socket.

   pending()
          Retrieve the number of bytes that can be safely read from the
          SSL buffer (not the underlying transport buffer).

   recv(bufsize)
          Receive data from the Connection. The return value is a string
          representing the data received. The maximum amount of data to be
          received at once, is specified by bufsize.

   bio_write(bytes)
          If the Connection was created with a memory BIO, this method can
          be used to add bytes to the read end of that memory BIO. The
          Connection can then read the bytes (for example, in response to
          a call to recv).

   renegotiate()
          Renegotiate the SSL session. Call this if you wish to change
          cipher suites or anything like that.

   send(string)
          Send the string data to the Connection.

   bio_read(bufsize)
          If the Connection was created with a memory BIO, this method can
          be used to read bytes from the write end of that memory BIO.
          Many Connection methods will add bytes which must be read in
          this manner or the buffer will eventually fill up and the
          Connection will be able to take no further actions.

   sendall(string)
          Send all of the string data to the Connection. This calls send
          repeatedly until all data is sent. If an error occurs, it's
          impossible to tell how much data has been sent.

   set_accept_state()
          Set the connection to work in server mode. The handshake will be
          handled automatically by read/write.

   set_app_data(data)
          Associate data with this Connection object. data can be
          retrieved later using the get_app_data method.

   set_connect_state()
          Set the connection to work in client mode. The handshake will be
          handled automatically by read/write.

   setblocking(flag)
          Call the setblocking method of the underlying socket.

   setsockopt(level, optname, value)
          Call the setsockopt method of the underlying socket.

   shutdown()
          Send the shutdown message to the Connection. Returns true if the
          shutdown message exchange is completed and false otherwise (in
          which case you call recv() or send() when the connection becomes
          readable/writeable.

   get_shutdown()
          Get the shutdown state of the Connection. Returns a bitvector of
          either or both of SENT_SHUTDOWN and RECEIVED_SHUTDOWN.

   set_shutdown(state)
          Set the shutdown state of the Connection. state is a bitvector
          of either or both of SENT_SHUTDOWN and RECEIVED_SHUTDOWN.

   sock_shutdown(how)
          Call the shutdown method of the underlying socket.

   bio_shutdown()
          If the Connection was created with a memory BIO, this method can
          be used to indicate that ``end of file'' has been reached on the
          read end of that memory BIO.

   state_string()
          Retrieve a verbose string detailing the state of the Connection.

   client_random()
          Retrieve the random value used with the client hello message.

   server_random()
          Retrieve the random value used with the server hello message.

   master_key()
          Retrieve the value of the master key for this session.

   want_read()
          Checks if more data has to be read from the transport layer to
          complete an operation.

   want_write()
          Checks if there is data to write to the transport layer to
          complete an operation.


                                  4 Internals

   We ran into three main problems developing this: Exceptions, callbacks
   and accessing socket methods. This is what this chapter is about.


4.1 Exceptions

   We realized early that most of the exceptions would be raised by the
   I/O functions of OpenSSL, so it felt natural to mimic OpenSSL's error
   code system, translating them into Python exceptions. This naturally
   gives us the exceptions SSL.ZeroReturnError, SSL.WantReadError,
   SSL.WantWriteError, SSL.WantX509LookupError and SSL.SysCallError.

   For more information about this, see section 3.3.


4.2 Callbacks

   There are a number of problems with callbacks. First of all, OpenSSL is
   written as a C library, it's not meant to have Python callbacks, so a
   way around that is needed. Another problem is thread support. A lot of
   the OpenSSL I/O functions can block if the socket is in blocking mode,
   and then you want other Python threads to be able to do other things.
   The real trouble is if you've released the global CPython interpreter
   lock to do a potentially blocking operation, and the operation calls a
   callback. Then we must take the GIL back, since calling Python APIs
   without holding it is not allowed.

   There are two solutions to the first problem, both of which are
   necessary. The first solution to use is if the C callback allows
   ''userdata'' to be passed to it (an arbitrary pointer normally). This
   is great! We can set our Python function object as the real userdata
   and emulate userdata for the Python function in another way. The other
   solution can be used if an object with an ''app_data'' system always is
   passed to the callback. For example, the SSL object in OpenSSL has
   app_data functions and in e.g. the verification callbacks, you can
   retrieve the related SSL object. What we do is to set our wrapper
   Connection object as app_data for the SSL object, and we can easily
   find the Python callback.

   The other problem is solved using thread local variables. Whenever the
   GIL is released before calling into an OpenSSL API, the PyThreadState
   pointer returned by PyEval_SaveState is stored in a global thread local
   variable (using Python's own TLS API, PyThread_set_key_value). When it
   is necessary to re-acquire the GIL, either after the OpenSSL API
   returns or in a C callback invoked by that OpenSSL API, the value of
   the thread local variable is retrieved (PyThread_get_key_value) and
   used to re-acquire the GIL. This allows Python threads to execute while
   OpenSSL APIs are running and allows use of any particular pyOpenSSL
   object from any Python thread, since there is no per-thread state
   associated with any of these objects and since OpenSSL is threadsafe
   (as long as properly initialized, as pyOpenSSL initializes it).


4.3 Acessing Socket Methods

   We quickly saw the benefit of wrapping socket methods in the
   SSL.Connection class, for an easy transition into using SSL. The
   problem here is that the socket module lacks a C API, and all the
   methods are declared static. One approach would be to have OpenSSL as a
   submodule to the socket module, placing all the code in socketmodule.c,
   but this is obviously not a good solution, since you might not want to
   import tonnes of extra stuff you're not going to use when importing the
   socket module. The other approach is to somehow get a pointer to the
   method to be called, either the C function, or a callable Python
   object. This is not really a good solution either, since there's a lot
   of lookups involved.

   The way it works is that you have to supply a ``socket-like'' transport
   object to the SSL.Connection. The only requirement of this object is
   that it has a fileno() method that returns a file descriptor that's
   valid at the C level (i.e. you can use the system calls read and
   write). If you want to use the connect() or accept() methods of the
   SSL.Connection object, the transport object has to supply such methods
   too. Apart from them, any method lookups in the SSL.Connection object
   that fail are passed on to the underlying transport object.

   Future changes might be to allow Python-level transport objects, that
   instead of having fileno() methods, have read() and write() methods, so
   more advanced features of Python can be used. This would probably
   entail some sort of OpenSSL ``BIOs'', but converting Python strings
   back and forth is expensive, so this shouldn't be used unless
   necessary. Other nice things would be to be able to pass in different
   transport objects for reading and writing, but then the fileno() method
   of SSL.Connection becomes virtually useless. Also, should the method
   resolution be used on the read-transport or the write-transport?
